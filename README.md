# ggqfc

Contains a simple theme for ggplot2, `theme_qfc()`, that loosely
resembles nicely themed plots (to my taste) from R base graphics. The
theme builds on `ggplot2::theme_light()`, and borrows heavily from Sean
Andersonâ€™s ggsidekick().

Installing:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("QFCatMSU/gg-qfc")
```

Exciting demo with dataset showing the number of breaks in yarn during
weaving for 2 yarn types and 3 tension levels:

``` r
library(ggqfc)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(warpbreaks, aes(tension, breaks)) + 
  geom_violin(fill = "grey90", col = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0, alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~wool) + labs(x = "Tension", y = "Breaks") +
  theme_qfc() # magic happens here
```
